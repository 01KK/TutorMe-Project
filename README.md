# CS3240 TutorMe UVA Project

This repository is a copy of a tutoring website project made for CS 3240 using Django. The site was hosted originally
on Heroku and allowed users to choose whether to sign up as a tutor or student. Tutors could search
for UVA classes and list their available times. Students could then search for  tutors and request
an appointment with them for a specific set schedule. Other extra features such a chat system, bug reporting
page, profile page, and calendar page were also added.
